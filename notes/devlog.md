These are raw notes and logs of what I was doing and what I was thinking at the time.

* Starting to get back into this after the move. Next goal is to improve the register access by
  using a macro of some kind. Want to move the addressing out of individual modules.
* Wrote a simple prototype in serial. Seems like it'll generalize eaisly. It does mean that the
  public API of each of the peripherals is a bit larger, and now the register map will happen in
  src/peripherals/mod.rs, but I think that makes more sense than happening in each file
  individually.
